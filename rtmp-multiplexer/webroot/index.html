  <h1>Woot!</h1>
  <p>The nginx-based RTMP multiplexer ("restreamer") seems to be running.</p>

  <h2>What now?</h2>
  <p>The next step is to configure this server to become a stream forwarder with a single endpoint or multiple endpoints. You might also want to edit the contents of this page, located at <strong>webroot/index.html</strong>, and you need to limit access to this server from the outside world.</p>

  <h3>Stream forwarder with a single endpoint ('lazy relay' or bridge mode)</h3>
  <p>If you want to have this server as some kind of single public endpoint between a certain sender and receiver, you can put the following configuration in <code>nginx.conf</code>:</p>
  
<pre><code>events {}
rtmp {
  server {
    listen 1935;
    chunk_size 4096;

    application live {
      live on;
      record off;
    }
  }
}</code></pre>

  <ul>
    <li>Send an RTMP stream to <code>rtmp://[your server ip]/live</code>, with livestream broadcasting software (Xsplit, OBS, Wirecast...). Use a stream key when necessary.</li>
    <li>Use an RTMP capable player like VLC to connect to rtmp://[your server ip]/live, using the same stream key if you have set up one.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Stream forwarder with multiple endpoints ('active relay' or multiplexing/restreaming mode)</h3>
  <p>Instead of having a relay, you can also easily set up a stream multiplexer. The stream multiplexer would take a single input stream and actively forward it to one or multiple endpoints. The following <code>nginx.conf</code> configuration does this:</p>

<pre><code>events {}
rtmp {
  server {
    listen 1935;
    chunk_size 4096;

    application live {
      live on;
      record off;
      push rtmp://[other streaming service]/[stream app][/stream key (optional)];
      push rtmp://[other streaming service]/[stream app][/stream key (optional)];
    }
  }
}</code></pre>

  <ul>
    <li>Edit the configuration to use your own destination endpoints.</li>
    <li>Send an RTMP stream to <code>rtmp://[your server ip]/live</code>, with livestream broadcasting software (Xsplit, OBS, Wirecast...). Use a stream key when necessary.</li>
    <li>Incoming RTMP streams are automatically forwarded/multiplexed/restreamed to all services.</li>
    <li>You can also still use an RTMP capable player like VLC to connect to rtmp://[your server ip]/live, using the same stream key if you have set up one. For example, when you want to have a 'feedback channel'.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Keep an eye on the security!</h2>
  <p>Remember to add security through firewalls or some sort of access control. Otherwise, anyone that knows your inbound RTMP URL could also stream to your other platforms through this server.</p>
